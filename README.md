<strong>Q.N. 3)</strong> The dataset survey in MASS package contains the responses from a sample of students at the University of Adelaide to a number of questions.

<ol>

 <li><strong>a)</strong> Import the data in R and determine how many questions the survey includes.</li>

 <li><strong>b)</strong> The variable sex refers to the gender of the student (“Male” and “Female”) and the variable Smoke indicates how much the student smokes. (“Heavy”, “Regul” (regularly), “Occas” (occasionally), “Never”.) Create a frequency table to determine number of male and female students in each of the four levels of Smoke.</li>

This is the subject of the 1995 Data Analysis Exposition sponsored by the Statistical Graphics Section of the American Statistical Association. The AAUP data includes average salary, overall compensation, and number of faculty broken down by full, associate, and assistant professor

ranks.  The data are provide in the link  <a href="http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/aaup.dat.txt">http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/aaup.dat.txt</a>




Here are some of the first few variables

1 –  5   FICE (Federal ID number)

7 – 37   College name

38 – 39   State (postal code)

40 – 43   Type  (I, IIA, or IIB)

44 – 48   Average salary – full professors

49 – 52   Average salary – associate professors

53 – 56   Average salary – assistant professors







<ol>

 <li>Import the data in R and determine its dimension.</li>

 <li>The Missing values are marked as “*”. How many observations have at least one missing value?</li>

 <li>Display the average salary of full professor, associate professor and assistant professor using parallel box plot.</li>

 <li>How many universities from the state of Indiana (IN) are included in this study?</li>
